### How do I get set up?

Requirements are as follows:
* PHP 5.4 or 7.0 _(7.0 recommended)_
* Apache 2.4
  * mod_headers
  * mod-php7.0 _(or mod-php5, if you prefer the older PHP version)_
  * mod_expires _(optional)_
  * mod_deflate _(optional)_

To get it running, simply upload to a directory of you choice and use the provided virtual host sample file. For easier upload, run `make`, to create a tarball containing only the necessary files.

### Code-style guidelines

* Line endings: UNIX
* Indentation: tabs
