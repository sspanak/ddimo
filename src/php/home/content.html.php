				<a href="/doftor/">Doctor's schedule</a> (in Bulgarian) – My general physicians have a very complicated schedule. It depends on which day of the week it is and if the date is an odd or an even number. Usually, when I am ill, I find calculating it difficult and annoying. This is why I created a simple Javascript tool that does it for me.
